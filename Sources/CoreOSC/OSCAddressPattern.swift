    /// An OSC Address Pattern.

    /// An OSC Address Pattern begins with the character ‘/’ followed by the symbolic ASCII names of all the containers,
    /// in order, along the path from the root of the tree to one or more OSC Methods, separated by forward slash characters,
    /// followed by the name of the OSC Methods.
    ///
    /// An OSC Address Pattern is different to an OSC Address in that it can contain wildcard characters
    /// and it is used to invoke one more OSC Methods in an OSC Address Space.
    ///
    /// Printable ASCII characters not allowed in names of OSC Methods or OSC Containers:
    /// - ' ' - Space
    /// - \# - Hash
    ///
    /// Wildcards:
    /// 1. ‘*’ in the OSC Address Pattern matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
    /// 2. ‘?’ in the OSC Address Pattern matches any single character.
    /// 3. A string of characters in square brackets (e.g., “[string]”) in the OSC Address Pattern matches any character in the string.
    ///   Inside square brackets, the minus sign (-) and exclamation point (!) have special meanings:
    ///     - two characters separated by a minus sign indicate the range of characters between the given two in ASCII collating sequence.
    ///       (A minus sign at the end of the string has no special meaning.)
    ///     - An exclamation point at the beginning of a bracketed string negates the sense of the list,
    ///       meaning that the list matches any character not in the list.
    ///       (An exclamation point anywhere besides the first character after the open bracket has no special meaning.)
    /// 4. A comma-separated list of strings enclosed in curly braces (e.g., “{foo,bar}”) in the OSC Address Pattern matches any of the strings in the list.
    /// 5. Any other character in an OSC Address Pattern can match only the same character.
    ///
    /// - Parameter addressPattern: The full path to one or more OSC Methods.
    /// - Throws: `OSCAddressError` if the format of the given address pattern is invalid.
